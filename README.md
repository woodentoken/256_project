# Reinforcement Learning for Aircraft Flight Control

This is a reinforcement learning flight control project for EEC256 at UC Davis, Spring 2025. 

The aircraft learns to preserve flight time and altitude following an engine out scenario.

I used JSBSim(https://jsbsim.sourceforge.net/) and stable baselines 3 to provide the environment and dynamics, respectively, for this project.
